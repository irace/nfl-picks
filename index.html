## Rules

### Making your picks

The season is broken up into three segments: weeks 1-8, weeks 9-16, and week 17, which is by itself.

Each week, each particpant chooses four teams. Each team can only be chosen once per segment, e.g. if a participant chooses the New York Jets in week 1, the Jets cannot be chosen again until week 9 when the next segment begins. During each of the first two eight-week segments, every NFL team will be chosen exactly once (8 weeks Ã— 4 teams/week = 32 NFL teams in total).

Of the four teams chosen per week, one team must be at least a five point underdog (See **Lines** section below for specifics about which lines are valid). If you are unable to choose any of the 5+ point underdogs on any given week (i.e. you've already picked them all in the current segment), you must choose whichever of the teams that you have left who is the biggest underdog.

#### Lines

The only official line is the 5dimes.eu line listed on ESPN's [Odds and Daily Lines](http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines) website. 

Lines become valid at 12:00 AM EST on Thursday of each week, e.g. if the team that you want to choose is a +5 on Wednesday, but only +4 on Thursday, *they do not count on an underdog*.

#### Weekly deadlines

All picks must be entered by the start of the 1PM games on Sunday *unless* you are picking one of the teams playing on Thursday night. When picking one of the teams playing on Thursday, you are required to enter your picks for that game only before the game begins.

### Scoring

Each participant will be awarded two points per victory from the team in their underdog slot, and one point for all other victories, allowing for a total of five points per week. Wins from teams in the underdog slot are worth two points *even if the team is not actually a 5+ point underdog*, as per the scenario outlined above.

### Week 17

For week 17 only, individual picks deadlines will be assigned to each participant in first-to-worst order. This ensures that no one can pick the exact same teams as the person who directly trails them directly, in order to prevent them from making a comeback.

Week 17 is the only week when you are *not* allowed to pick two teams that are playing against one another.

### Forgetting to enter your picks

If you forget to enter picks one week, the best teams that you still have available for the current segment will automatically be chosen for you.
