    <h1>NFL picks rules</h1>

    <p>Last modified: 9/25/2016</p>

    <h2>Making your picks</h2>

    <p>The season is broken up into three segments: weeks 1-8, weeks 9-16, and week 17, which is by itself.</p>

    <p>Each week, each particpant chooses four teams. Each team can only be chosen once per segment, e.g. if a
      participant chooses the New York Jets in week 1, the Jets cannot be chosen again until week 9 when the next
      segment begins. During each of the first two eight-week segments, every NFL team will be chosen exactly once (8
      weeks × 4 teams/week = 32 NFL teams in total).</p>

    <p>Of the four teams chosen per week, one team must be at least a five point underdog (See <strong>Lines</strong>
      section below for specifics about which lines are valid). If you are unable to choose any of the 5+ point
      underdogs on any given week (i.e. you've already picked them all in the current segment), you are allowed to
      choose any team who at any point beyond Thursday 12:00AM was the biggest underdog at the time. For example, say
      KC is the biggest underdog you have left at +1, on Thursday at 1PM. KC’s line subsequently moves to +2.5, leaving
      SEA as the biggest underdog remaining at +1.5. You can still pick KC as your underdog because at one point on
      Thursday, they were the biggest underdog.</p>

    <p>If a team is your biggest remaining underdog at the time that their game kicks off (e.g. Thursday night), you
      <em>must</em> pick them as your underdog, even if the lines subsequently move such that another team that you
      still have left is now a bigger underdog for their own start time (e.g. Sunday afternoon).</p>

    <h3>Lines</h3>

    <p>The only official line is the Westgate line listed on ESPN's <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines">Odds and
        Daily Lines</a> website. </p>

    <p>Lines become valid at 12:00 AM EST on Thursday of each week, e.g. if the team that you want to choose is a +5 on
      Wednesday, but only +4 on Thursday, <em>they do not count as an underdog</em>.</p>

    <h3>Weekly deadlines</h3>

    <p>Once a game has started it can no longer be picked, e.g. you must enter a Thursday night pick on Thursday but
      can wait until Sunday to enter the rest. If you didn’t enter any picks on Sunday, you can still pick one (or
      both) of the teams playing on Monday. At the end of the week, any invalid picks (e.g. picking a team who you were
      not eligible to pick that week) or picks that were left unmade will be automatically chosen for you, without
      mercy (the best team(s) who happened to lose that week).</p>

    <p>If you're unable to enter your picks in the spreadsheet, make sure you send your picks via email to others in
      the group before the deadline, to ensure that there's a (digital) paper trail. But really you should be able to
      enter them on time, considering that you probably have a smartphone and that the Google mobile apps work just
      fine in a pinch.</p>

    <h3>Rules specific to week 17</h3>

    <p>For week 17 only, individual picks deadlines will be assigned to each participant in first-to-worst order. This
      ensures that no one can pick the exact same teams as the person who directly trails them, in order to prevent
      them from making a comeback.</p>

    <p>Week 17 is the only week when you are <em>not</em> allowed to pick two teams that are playing against one
      another.</p>

    <h3>Forgetting to enter your picks</h3>

    <p>If you forget to enter picks one week, the best teams that you still have available for the current segment will
      automatically be chosen for you.</p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>

    <p>Each participant will be awarded two points per victory from the team in their underdog slot, and one point for
      all other victories, allowing for a total of five points per week. Wins from teams in the underdog slot are worth
      two points <em>even if the team is not actually a 5+ point underdog</em>, as per the scenario outlined above.</p>

    <p>Whoever has the most points at the end of the season is the winner – simple as that.</p>
